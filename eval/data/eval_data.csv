"question","expected"
"What is the primary consensus mechanism in Mina?","Mina uses Proof of Stake, a modified version of Ouroboros Praos."
"How does Mina's Ouroboros differ from Ouroboros Genesis?","Mina extends Praos, not implementing Genesis due to its unsuitability for succinct blockchains."
"What is the Epoch Ledger Optimization in Mina?","It limits stored information for proposers, using SNARKs for efficient VRF evaluation proof."
"What are the primary responsibilities of a block producer in Mina?","Create new blocks with transactions and blockchain proofs, ensuring consensus and security."
"How is a block producer chosen in Mina?","Using a verifiable random function (VRF) proportional to their staked funds."
"What is a 'Supercharged coinbase' in Mina?","Double coinbase rewards for block producers without time-locked tokens."
"What is the role of SNARK workers in the Mina network?","SNARK workers produce SNARK proofs of transactions, maintaining the succinctness of the Mina blockchain."
"How does the Snarketplace function in Mina?","Block producers buy SNARK proofs from SNARK workers, establishing a market price through supply and demand dynamics."
"What determines the opportunity for SNARK workers to do work?","The need for SNARK proofs is driven by the rate of transaction addition, creating demand for their services in the snarketplace."
"What are the ways to participate in the Mina network?","By staking MINA, delegating it to another node, or becoming a SNARK worker."
"How do staking rewards work in Mina?","Stake delegation takes effect after 2-4 weeks, with the option to undelegate anytime without penalty."
"What is the role of SNARK-workers in the Mina network?","SNARK-workers generate zk-SNARKs for transactions, helping to maintain the network's succinct blockchain size."
How many Fields token storage has?,8 Fields
How can maps be implemented in SmartContract?,Token accounts can be used
"What are the two main components of a zkApp?","A zkApp consists of a smart contract and a user interface (UI)."
"How does the zkApp smart contract process work?","The smart contract uses o1js to create a prover function that generates a zero knowledge proof in the user's browser."
"How is state updated in a zkApp?","The prover function generates account updates, which are sent to a zkApp address on the Mina network for state update validation."
"How is a payment initiated in the Mina network?","A user, like Bob, creates and signs a payment, which is then sent to peers on the network."
"What happens to a payment in the block production stage?","The block producer selects the payment, generates a SNARK for the new block, and sends it to SNARK workers for processing."
"What are the reasons for a payment failure in Mina?","Failure can occur if the transaction is fundamentally invalid, or if it gets evicted from the transaction pool due to capacity and low fees."
